# Hello!

I'm Lucas, a computer engineering student living in Natal, Rio Grande do Norte, Brazil.

## Undergraduate Research Projects
* Implementation and evaluation of the performance of the VTTS Algorithm in GNSS-SDR. Our aim is to integrate VTTS into an open-source receiver for a realistic assessment of its advantages and disadvantages compared to other GPS signal acquisition methods.

* Research project funded by the Norwegian company Equinor. The general objective of this project is to improve seismic resolution in complex geological structures of Brazilian pre-salt reservoirs, incorporating advanced methods to deal with signal attenuation; noise and other challenges related to the pre-salt seismic signal. The methodologies developed and tested with positive results will be computationally innovative for application on a production scale. My role in the project is to support the development of high-performance geophysical applications.

## Interests

* High Performance Computing
* Parallel Algorithms and Architectures
